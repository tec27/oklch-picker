# OKLCH Palette Generator

> Forked from [OKLCH Palette Generator](https://github.com/pleisto/oklch-picker), with added hue
> shift, which was forked from [LCH Color Picker](https://github.com/evilmartians/oklch-picker), to
> add a palette generator.

OKLCH is a new way to encode colors (likeÂ hex, RGBA, or HSL):

- OKLCH has native browser support.
- It can encode more colors for modern screens (P3, Rec. 2020, and beyond).
- [Unlike HSL], OKLCH always has predictable contrast
  after color transformation.
- In contrast [with LCH and Lab], no [hue shift] on chroma changes.
- Provides great a11y on palette generation.

## Development

To run a local copy for development:

1. Install correct versions of `Node.js` and `pnpm`. There are two ways:

   1. With `asdf` version manager:
      1. Install [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and asdf plugins for `Node.js` and `pnpm`
      2. Run `asdf install`
   2. Manually (check needed versions in `.tool-versions`)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run local server:

   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

We recommend to install Prettier and EditorConfig plugins to your text editor.
